Afternoon Financial Roundup

Hi Mike,

Here’s a quick financial roundup:

- Market overview: Mixed session today. Stay focused on your long-term positions and watch sectors you follow closely.
- Crypto watch: Keep an eye on BTC and SOL; consider setting alerts for your target levels.
- Portfolio note: No urgent actions recommended unless your stop-loss/targets are hit.

If you want specific price data (indices, stocks, or crypto), tell me which tickers and I’ll include live numbers next time.
