Top 3 priorities (today)
1) Taxes block (09:00–12:05): pre-stage docs, then push to “done” on at least one concrete sub-task (W2, 1099s, deductions, etc.).
2) Sirius call (09:00): go in with a target price + walk-away; take a note of rep name + confirmation #.
3) TA Quant Call + Tristian links: capture only 3 bullets: what changed, what matters, what you’ll do next.

- TSLA/MSTR have been volatile — consider tightening risk (position sizing / stops) before adding.

Quick reminders
- Sirius: get the new rate in writing/confirmation email.
- Wells mortgage payment change: set a calendar reminder for March 1 to verify it actually took.
