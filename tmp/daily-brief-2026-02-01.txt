- BTC: $78,012 (24h: -4.76%)
- SOL: $104.00 (24h: -7.39%)
- HYPE: $29.32 (24h: -0.67%)

6) Money moves / watchlist
- BTC/SOL are in a sharp down move: if you want adds, consider pre-setting small staggered limit buys (and a max daily risk cap).
- MSTR had a big up day Friday; worth checking whether it’s simply tracking BTC beta or company-specific news before adding.

7) Quick reminders
- Sirius call tomorrow 9:00 AM: decide your walk-away price and your “acceptable plan/features” list.
- Taxes block tomorrow morning: gather the missing docs tonight (10 minutes) so it’s not a scavenger hunt.

8) What Silicon Minion is working on today
- I can’t run live web_search (Brave key missing), so I pulled news via RSS sources. If you want broader news coverage, we can add a Brave API key.
- I’ll keep using CoinGecko + Stooq for the daily price snapshot unless you prefer a different source.
- If you want, I can draft a 1‑page Sirius negotiation script for tomorrow.
Question: Do you want the daily brief to include your ConnectClub “one key next step” each day (yes/no)?

9) Health nudge
It’s cold out this morning—layer up if you walk. A short mobility + 20–30 min Zone 2 ride today keeps the streak alive without stealing Sunday.

NOT financial advice.
